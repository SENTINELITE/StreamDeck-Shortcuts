Welcome to the StreamDeck Shortcuts Repository!


I wanted to run my shortcuts on my StreamDeck,  was using another plugin, but ended up bricking said plugin, on the first day. After multiple uninstalls & & computer restarts, it just wouldn’t work. That was the start…

Of course I wasn’t going to make a simple thing. No, I had to do it the justice it so rightly deserved.

What started as a simple: “Let’s run Shortcuts on the StreamDeck”, turned into a fun learning process!
