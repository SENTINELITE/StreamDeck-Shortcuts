### Backstory
I wanted to run my Shortcuts on my StreamDeck, but the go-to solution bricked on me, on the first day. Whatever I did, I couldn’t get it working again. That was the start of this project…

Of course, I wasn’t going to make a simple thing. No, I had to do it the justice it so rightly deserved. 😝

### Lost, But Not Forgotten Features:
- Set Discord/GitHub image/logo beside their description text?
- isPrivateAnalytics Bool, to allow user’s to toggle Analytics.
- Move settings into a popup window? See Elgato PI Demo.
- Don’t send a payload, if settings haven’t changed. Only send what *has* changed. Show if settings changed by showing an “X” on the save box, instead of the green box.
- We shouldn’t send all the shortcuts, only a limited few. The payload is probably too big, for larger libraries.
- Allow user to switch Accessibility speed. Only some voices support this…
- Allow for accessibility toggle. Ie, some people may not/want to hold down for x amount of time. Create an option to tap, starting the timer, then another tap confirm or cancel, when the timer finishes.
- 🚀 Create Shortcut from Button Press?
- 🚀 Open/Edit Shortcut in the Shortcuts.app
